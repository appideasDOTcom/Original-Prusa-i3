# Forked from the fine folks at Prusa

Thanks to the fact that Prusa has Open Sourced their designs, I own a cheap i3 MK2 clone that has a few differences from a genuine Prusa, so their models need a few changes to work for me and others like me. My changes should stick mostly to the MK2 branch, and since Prusa doesn't appear merge that branch back to master, I won't either.
